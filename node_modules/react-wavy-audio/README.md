# React Wavy Audio

React player library to display audio with waveform

This package uses [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) under the hood and provides an easier way 
to use it in react applications.
It is a wrapper for wavesurfer.js, you can use it is a reference or use it directly in your react apps.

It covers basic features, but if you want something else supported, please feel free to open an issue, and contribute. ðŸ˜„

If you find any issues, please do let me know and we can fix it as soon as possible :)

## Props

| Props  | Type  | Default  | Description |

| hideWave   | bool  | false  | Hide the wave formation | 
| waveStyles  | object  | { responsive: true }  | The list of paramterers which can be found [here](https://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/options.html) to change default settings and style of the waveplayer |
| waveJson  | Json  | N/A   | You can use the (audiowaveform)[https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform] to generate the waveform data on server and pass it through this props to the player.

| audioUrl  | url  | N/A | The url to load audio from |
| zoom  |  number | 0  | Widens the waveform in display, Try it out in example |
| imageUrl  | url  | N/A  | The image to be shown right next to the player. It is not required |
| events | Json | N/A | You can pass a json object with events available [here](http://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/events.html) . Use `wavesurfer` for manipulation. Only `on` events supported for now. Example: {'pause' : () => { wavesurfer.params.container.style.opacity = 0.9} } 
| hideImage  | bool  | false  | To hide the image if imageUrl is present |
| containerStyles  | Style object  | Check Below | Styles for the container of player 

``` 
                    {
                        display: "flex",
                        flexDirection: "row",
                        maxWidth: "50vh",
